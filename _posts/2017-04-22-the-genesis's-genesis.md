# Before programming what was there, turns out not much

> In the beginning there was nothing. God said, 'Let there be light!' And there was light.
>> Genesis 1:1-3  

> There was still nothing, but you could see it a whole lot better.
>> Ellen DeGeneres

   If the title gives anything away, due to its inherently meta-post nature, and you gleaned that the content here will offer some perspective on the content to follow (in the next post), you'd be right. It's impotant to note that my "official" programming beginning - covered in my next post aptly titled "The Genesis: after programming" - covers the beginnings of my more formal path with Bloc - an online coding bootcamp.<sup>1</sup> If you would like to start there I urge you to do so. 
  
The good news is that since programming so wholly engulfs one's world, before programming there wasn't much, at least out of the ordinary by the way of education. I don't mean I didn't find school interesting, I did. I don't mean that I found other things to do besides homework. In fact by most measures I was a very good student, in a very cliche way, does his hw and gets staright A's.  What I mean by not much out of the ordinary was my curriculum. I took history, english, and incrementally more complex math and science classes from elementary school through h.s. My only foray into computers was a class called Intro to Computer Concepts, which fufilled the one semester C.S. req'ment that was needed to graduate. Once I realized the most difficult concepts we would tackle that semester were Word and Excel, I naturally presumed the obvious, that is outside of minor tweaks and some refinement, I had mastered computers. I was not aware of the entire field that is computer science. In my defense, how should I have been made aware? This was before I became aware of what I did not know as is with many in their youth.<sup>2</sup> And so my life went, without knowledge of the field of CS. I was therefore unable to make the link between all the new tech tech ( think 2005-2010) nad its intertwinedness with software(i.e. I recognized Facebook as new but not new tech; as I couldn't decouple it from the internet, which I also had a rudimentary understanding of). I continued to only recognize new tech as new hardware. Think motorola razor. Think iPod. My true programming beginnings were hatched 3 years later when I purchased a late model 2011 Macbook Pro. And still it would be another 3 full years until I would write my first lines of code.<sup>3</sup> My journey to programming was by no means a straight shot, it may have been unique, but certainly was not direct. In fact, metaphorically, I took the long way. Nevertheless whats important is I made it.  

<sup>1</sup> The term bootcamp hardly lends itself to the idea that you're program may be 54 weeks long, the length of the software developer track I am enrolled in. More on this is in "The Genesis"   

<sup>2</sup> Not knowing what you do not know is very much a trait of the young that certainly lends to their perceived boldness from elders.  

<sup>3</sup> The first lines of code were writen in python with the Sublime text editor executed in the command-line shell.
